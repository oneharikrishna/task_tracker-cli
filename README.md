Good Evening buddies,
For running this task_tracker cli in your local environment there is two ways for doing that
1) You should have a cargo(Rust's manager and build tool), since I have developed this project in rust. So that you can clone this repo and change my code according to your need and build your own .exe file and run it
2) If you don't have any rust build tools, go to [target folder and get the release](https://github.com/oneharikrishna/task_tracker-cli/blob/main/task_tracker/target/release/task_tracker.exe) and open you command prompt and start using it like a cli
but following the second approadch might limit you to use the .exe depending upon the OS you use.

for cloning follow this [link](https://github.com/oneharikrishna/task_tracker-cli)

for running the cli app using .exe file, you have to use task_tracker.exe for every commands you use for example
task_tracker.exe add "Buy Groceries"
task_tracker update 1 "Buy Groceries and cook"


Thats it, If you have further doubts to clarify you can [Email me](mailto:harikrishna09876543@gmail.com)

And I want to thanks [RoadMap](https://roadmap.sh) for this wonderful [opportunity](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker)

Just Keep Coding
